# Week 01

- Question 1: Using `linear_model.py`

    a) Update the code in `linear_model.py` to work with `f2` function, and
or function in the homework

    b) Change the code from basic python to vector-based, using numpy library
    
- Question 2: Using notebook and `and_function.ipynb`
    
    a) Update the code to generate the same datasamples based on the provided seed
    
    b) Use `np.savetxt` the generated data into `andstd02_seed.txt` and `andstd02_seed.txt`
    with `seed` is the given seed
    
    c) Update the `linear_model.py` to read data from the two input files and
    calculate the accuracy of `f1` and `f2` function
