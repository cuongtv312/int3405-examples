# Week 02

+ Question 1: Update linear_model.py for computing the expected accuracy of homework 2.2

+ Question 2: Building ID3 Tree.
    + Complete the `compute_infomation_gain` function in `ID3.py`, using to calculate the
    information gain of feature `Outlook`
    + Try to build the ID3 tree for classifying the `playtennis.csv`,
    print the tree to otuput
    
+ Question 3*: Using `decision_tree.py`
    + Complete the building decision tree methods and using to classify the difficult 
    noisy and dataset
    + Report the train and test accuracy
    You should try and report the train/test accuracy with different configs: `n_train`, `n_test`, `std`.
    What happens when train and test have different `std`
