# Week 02

+ Task 0: Run and check the `test_random_tree.py` for working
with the noisy and dataset and a shift in train/test distribution

+ Task 1: use `perceptron.py` and `train_perceptron.csv` for training a perceptron model.
Could you report the boundary of the decision function, follows the slides

+ Task 2: use `naive_bayes.py` and `train_nb.csv` to train 
a naive bayes model with smoothing. Report the accuracy in the test_nb.csv 
    
+ Task 3*: Bases on the `perceptron.py` or `naive_bayes.py`, modify to work with the
noisy And dataset from Task 0. Hints: If you choose perceptron approach,
you could apply pytorch for fitting a perceptron using batch stochastic gradient descent
Or If you choose to use naive_bayes, use gaussian distributions to learn
the distribution of features
